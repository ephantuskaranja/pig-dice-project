## Description
This game consists of two players. Each of them rolls the dice earning points until on hold or when the player rolls dice of value 1. The next player takes over until on hold or rolls dice value 1. At start of every game, the winner score is set before game starts. The rule of the game is that player earns points equivalent to the value of rolled dice. If player holds, he/she forfeits another chance to roll the dice and it becomes the next player's turn to roll the dice. The game is over when the winner is reached. And the game restarts.
